ATM v1.0 
Accounts :
Card # - Pin   - Accounts Accessed
1      - 42    - Checking & Savings
2      - 1234  - Checking & Money Market

Note : Both accounts access same checking account

Checking : 100$
Savings  : 1000$
Market   : 5000$

Simulation # 1:
ATM starts with 10 x 20 $ bills = 200$

Exploratory testing plan :

Our plan is to initially test if we are able to access our banking account using both card #s. We will attempt to insert invalid and
valid credentials and observe how the system reacts. We will then test a deposit, to see
if the money will be deposited properly. We will do that on all 3 types of account, Checking, Savings, Money Market,
check the balances of the accounts, and see if they match. For the checking account, we wwill check and see if when deposits or withdrawals are made on one card, if they show up
on both cards, ie check to see if actually both cards connect to the same checking account. Then we will test each transaction type,
Withdrawal, Deposit, Transfer, Balance Inquiry. In between, of each transaction we will ask for a balance, retrieve card, and reinsert
and see if the balances match the expected result. We will also, check to see if we attempt to withdraw more money than the atm holds,
what the result will be. We will test and see if the logs match the transactions.

Note : It's important to note we performed these tests in succession, and also, the regression was performed in the same order.

Test #1 : (card 1)
Login in first card with #1, Password 42
Expected Result   : Successful Login
Actual            : Successful Login
Test Status       : Pass

Regression Result : Invalid Account Type
Regression Stat   : Pass

Test #5 : (Card 1)
